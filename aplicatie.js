              <p>Agreed, Harry &#128077;.We had some good moments, but we need to be more clinical in front of the goal &#128533;.</p>

              <p>We need to control the midfield and exploit their defensive weaknesses. Bruno and Paul, I'm counting on your creativity.Marcus and Jadon, stretch their defense wide.Use your pace and take on their full-backs.</p>
